1. mydic = {}

2. dic = {'foo': 42}

3. A dictionary stores unordered key-value pairs, while a list stores ordered elements.

4. If you try to access spam['foo'] if spam is {'bar': 100} results in 'KeyError'
   error message which is similar to list's "out-of-range" IndexError message.

5. 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.keys() does the same thing that is to check whether 
   there is a key named 'cat' is there in dictionary or not. But 'cat' in spam.keys() 
   requires an additional function call which makes it less effecient.

6. 'cat' in spam checks the presence of a key named 'cat' in the dictionary spam where as
   'cat' in spam.values() checks the presence of a value named 'cat' in the dictionary spam.

7. spam.setdefault('color', 'black')

8. pprint module and pprint() function can be used to "pretty print" dictionary values.
