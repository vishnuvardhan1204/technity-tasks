1. An escape character lets you use the characters that are otherwise impossible to use in a string.

2. \n  -> Newline/Line break
   \t  -> Tab

3. By making the string a raw string by placing a 'r' before the beginning quotation marks of a string.

4. It isn't a problem because we used double quotes the mark start and end of string. So, any other character 
   like single quote will be considered as a part of string.

5. We can use Multiline strings that are written in between triple-single/double quotes.

6. 'Hello, world!'[1]    -> 'e'
   'Hello, world!'[0:5]  -> 'Hello'
   'Hello, world!'[:5]   -> 'Hello'
   'Hello, world!'[3:]   -> 'lo, world!'

7. 'Hello'.upper()            -> 'HELLO'
   'Hello'.upper().isupper()  -> True  
   'Hello'.upper().lower()    -> 'hello'

8. 'Remember, remember, the fifth of November.'.split()  ->  ['Remember,', 'remember, 'the', 'fifth', 'of', 'November.']
   '-'.join('There can be only one.'.split())            ->  'There-can-be-only-one.'

9. rjust(),ljust(),center() methods are used to right-justify, left-justify, and center a string.

10. By using the string methods strip(), rstrip(), lstrip() we can trim whitespace characters from beginning or end of a string.
