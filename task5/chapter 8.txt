1. No, we have to install it using Pip. To install PyInputPlus

2. We commonly import as import pyinputplus as pyip so that whenever 
   we call a function we can write as pyip.func() instead of using pyinputplus.

3. inputInt() only takes integers as input where as inputFloat() takes floating-point
   values also as an input along with integer values.

4. import pyinputplus as pyip

   response=pyip.inputInt(lessThan=99,greaterThan=0)

   The above line makes sure that input will be a integer that is greater than 0 and
   less than 99 i.e. whole number between 0 and 99.

5. A List of regular expression strings are passed to allowRegexes and blockRegexes arguments.

6. After entering blank input three times, it shows retrylimitexception. After that it specifies
   time and after completing of time it prints TimeoutException.

7. After the limit is reached, it stores the default 'hello' as input.
