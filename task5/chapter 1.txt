1. Operators: *,-,/,+
   Values: 'hello',-88.8,5

2. Variable : spam
   String: 'spam'

3. 3 data types: int,float,string

4. An expression is a combination of values, operators, and variables that can be evaluated to produce a single value.

5. Expressions are used to compute values, while statements are used to perform actions or control the flow of a program.

6. After running the following code, bacon = 20, because bacon+1 doesn't affect the value of bacon

7. 'spam'+'spamspam' = 'spamspamspam'
   'spam'*3 = 'spamspamspam'

8. For a variable name to be valid it shouldn't start with number.
   So, eggs is a valid variable name where as 100 isn't a valid varible name.

9. By using int(),float(),str() functions, we can get integer, floating-point,
   string versions of a value.

10. 'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos ' 
    An expression always evaluate values of same datatypes. But here 99 is an integer,
    where as other two are strings. So, expression is invalid. To validate it we use str() function.

    'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos ' = 'I have eaten 99 burritos '
